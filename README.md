# nassCDS-dataset-analysis

This is the project done for my Statistical Learning class in Uni. We analyzed a publically available dataset (in our case, a dataset of traffic accidents in the USA) with R.
The Stat_project_backup.html file contains our final report, including all the code we used and our conclusions. We wrote it using R Markdown.
